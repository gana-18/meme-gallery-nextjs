<h3>Project Outline: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Features of this meme gallery include infinite scrolling for every 100 memes, gallery, zoom in and out.</li>
<li>The typical nextjs feature loading.jsx is used and since there are no routes/dynamic routes for it to apply automatically it is used in the if/else condition as a component.</li>
<li>Lazy loading is used for gifs and priority is set to true for videos as they take maximum time while fetching.</li>
<li>The website is responsive.</li>
</ul>
